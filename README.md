# OBJECT-DETECTION

This is a object detection proogram.

We have used YOLO algorithm, with the config model file and frozen model file. obtained from github.

Then the programs identifies the object when the config file and frozen model identifies an object

Labels have an array of names and that name is displayed on fidning the respective object that meets the match with the config file and labels together.

The output hasa good accuracy in finding the object

Output can be predicted for both image and video and even on a webcam live detection.
